I was born in Almelo at the beginning 1967. So that's a long long time ago. 

As a child we moved a lot, living at several places. I have old older brother and joger sister.
In the mid 70's we  move to the Leiden regio, where I still live. I've done most of school and education
here. My latest grades are for fysical and occupational therapy. Then, a tat late some would say, I
started to play with  tech stuff, computers and networks. Evolving a projects
like Wireless Leiden, Open Community Camp and most late, MakerSpace Leiden. 

From a retrospective, I 've alway been occupied with tech and people; getting 
things organised and done. But also a long list of unfished or dead projects;
there are a of things that pass my buzy mind.

Over the last couple of years I tend to move a bit away from tech, exploring
other sides of humanity.
