It seems to be a very sensive radar for the things that are "not right".

This kind knowing is not as the intelligence of the Mind or Heart.

By it self, there is a lot to sense and to explore. 

Sometimes to ignore and sometimes, when the mind 
and heart finally quiet a nice place to be. 

And from there great place to expand from,
to everything that lives, the earth and the universe...
