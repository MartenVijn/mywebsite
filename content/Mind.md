I love being active in creative thinking and problem resolving.

I have a poppy mind, and more important know how to move ideas into plans into the physical
world. 

The other side also is thati I can restless and never seem to have time to read a book or just
do nothing. 

This nothing seems a universe I am starting to explore. To start with a gentle pauze for my mind, with 
some gratutude for all the great ideas it has spawned.
