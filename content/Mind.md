I love being active in creative thinking and problem resolving.

I have a poppy mind, and more important now how move ideas into plans into the fysical
world. 

The other side also is that can restless and never seem to have time to read a book or just
do nothing. 

This nothing is a universe I am beginning to explore. To start with a gentle pauze for my mind, with 
gratutude for all the great ideas it has spawned.
