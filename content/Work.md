Up to 2005 I 've been working in healthcare, rehabilitation, upto the moment
where administration seemed to become more important than patients.

I loved to that that dive to explore minds that suffered from stroke or blunt braindamage
to see what still is possible and work with that to improve quality of live. Actually I
still do.

Now, inspired by the  open source movement, I am working in tech, doing the infra/ops side of DevOps. Doing
this for almost 2 decades at SRON, Leiden University and currently Divider.

In my spare time do sometime small jobs like 2/3D designs, prototyping or help 
grassroots or NGO's with their tech setup like building websites, social media
or communication platforms.


And, not to forget,  also sometime organise small events around meditation and self exploration.
